# -------------------
# GE Discovery NM 670

# Default orientation is towards Z axis.
# According to CT image: need a rotation around X to start looking towards Y.

# Lengths: X is slightly larger than Y, like indicated on the collimator plane

# Width: arbitrary but must be larger than the larger collimator. Not too much
# to avoid intersection with phantom.

# Crystal width varies between device.
# Crystal is NaI (not Thallium-doped sodium iodide NaI(Tl))
# thickness is 3/8 of inch (depends on device)

# -------------------

# Default orientation is collimator look towards Z axis (photon going towards collimator are -Z)
# Rotation around X to start looking towards Y, like CT image.

# SPECT Head: main volume, everything is included in SPECThead
# the name MUST be SPECThead
