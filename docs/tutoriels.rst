Tutoriels
=========


We've created tutorials for GATE (SPECT and PET) and Castor (reconstruction) and made them available on GitHub. 
Macros and step by step guidance can be accessed via the links below. 
We also offer complimentary phantoms for quality control and realistic clinical studies. 
Additionally, we provide a tutorial on GATE data analysis, along with sample codes.
