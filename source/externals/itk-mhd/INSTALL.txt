MetaIO
======

MetaIO provides a straightforward file format for storing N-Dimensional image
data as well as common "spatial" objects: tubes. ellipses, meshes, etc.

MetaIO documentation is available online at:
   http://www.itk.org/Wiki/MetaIO

The concepts and uses of spatialObjects is presented in the ITK Software Guide:
   http://www.itk.org/HTML/Documentation.htm

This file exists in the central repository for MetaIO.

Installation
============

The cvs repositories of ITK (www.itk.org) and VTK (www.vtk.org) include
links directly to the src subdirectory so that those repositories can
share a common MetaIO implementation.

To allow ITK and VTK to be compiled together, without duplication of
symbols from MetaIO, a local configuration file must also be installed
one level above the MetaIO src directory in each repository.

When manually installing into ITK,
1) Delete ITK's existing MetaIO installation
     > rm -rf ${ITK_SOURCE_DIR}/Utilities/MetaIO
     > rm -f ${ITK_SOURCE_DIR}/Utilities/metaIOConfig.h
2) the contents of MetaIO/src should be copied to ${ITK_SOURCE_DIR}/Utilities/MetaIO.
     > cp src/* ${ITK_SOURCE_DIR}/Utilities/MetaIO/
3) the appropriate configuration file should be installed
     > cp itkMetaIOConfig.h ${ITK_SOURCE_DIR}/Utilities/metaIOConfig.h

When manually installing into VTK
1) Delete VTK's existing MetaIO installation
     > rm -rf ${VTK_SOURCE_DIR}/Utilities/vtkmetaio
     > rm -f ${VTK_SOURCE_DIR}/Utilities/metaIOConfig.h
2) the contents of MetaIO/src should be copied to ${VTK_SOURCE_DIR}/Utilities/vtkmetaio.
     > cp src/* ${VTK_SOURCE_DIR}/Utilities/vtkmetaio/
3) the appropriate configuration file should be installed
     > cp vtkMetaIOConfig.h ${VTK_SOURCE_DIR}/Utilities/metaIOConfig.h

When installing stand-alone
WARNING!!! The stand-alone version of MetaIO uses the same configuration
(namespace and config files) as the ITK version of MetaIO, so it is not
possible for the stand-alone version of MetaIO to be installed with a full
verion of ITK.
1) Configure as you would any other project that is configured using cmake.
    e.g., create a new directory called MetaIO-Bin and then from within
    cmake set MetaIO as the source directory and MetaIO-Bin as the binary
    directory, press configure, and then press go.
2) Build using any "modern" compiler
    e.g., gcc 2.95 or later, Sun-CC 2.8 or later, MS Visual Studio 6.0 or later
