/*! \class  GateSystemComponent
    \brief  A GateSystemComponent is a level of a system (GateVSystem)
    
    - GateSystemComponent - by Daniel.Strul@iphe.unil.ch (Oct 2002)
    
    - A system component is part of of a component tree: it handles a tree of subcomponents,
      and may be a daughter of some higher-level component. The whole tree defines a 'system',
      i.e. a geometry model: in this model, each component has a predefined role (detector
      head, crystal matrix, collimator...)
    
    - A component tree provides a pre-defined model of a geometry, such as a scanner or a 
      detector block. In this model, each component has a specific role (detector head, 
      crystal matrix, collimator...)
    
    - System components are activated when they are connected to an creator of the geometry.
      Once a component is thus connected, it can read the creator properties, such as its
      dimensions, position, movement parameters, number of copies...
      
    - For example, a typical PET scanner would incorporate a component for the detector 
      blocks ('rsector', 'block', 'bucket'...). This component would then be connected
      to the one geometry creator that models this detector block. Once this connection
      is done, one can read the scanner properties that are related to the blocks: number
      of rings, number of blocks per ring, internal diameter... Along with all its subcomponents,
      thus block-component would allow to read all the detector properties.

    - Note that the component methods are of two distinct types: for some of them, the component
      just answers for itself; for others, it recursively calls the methods of all its subcomponents

    - Note: from July to Oct. 2002, a system was a vector of system-levels, each level managing a
      vector of components. On Oct. 2002, the whole system (which was too complex) was redesigned, 
      and the current mechanism (tree of system-components) replaced the previous one (vector of
      system-levels)
