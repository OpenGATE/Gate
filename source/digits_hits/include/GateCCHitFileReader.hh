  \brief  Reads hits data from a ROOT simulation-output file and recreates hit-collections for digitisation

  - The GateCCHitFileReader is a singleton. It is designed to be used in the DigiGate mode.
  In this mode, the GateCCHitFileReader will read hits data from a ROOT simulation-output file.
  Based on these data, it will recreate hit-collections that can be fed to the digitizer to
  reprocess the hits.
