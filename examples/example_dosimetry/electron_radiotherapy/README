--------------------------
This example illustrates the simulation of a Clinac 2100C linear accelerator operating in 6MeV electron mode
for a thoracic irradiation of a RANDO phantom


--------------------------
The linac head described in the macro linac_6MeV.mac consists in :

   + a vacuum window : exit window in beryllium
   + a 6MeV scattering foil : in tantalum
   + an ionization chamber : kapton-air-copper slabs
   + X and Y Jaws : defining a 20x20cm aperture adapted to the 10x10cm applicator
   + a 10x10cm applicator
   + a 10x10cm cerrobend cut-out
   
   
--------------------------
The phantom :

   + a RANDO phantom
   + SSD set to 100 cm, gantry 60 deg
  

--------------------------
The source is described in the macro beam_6MeV.mac.

It consists in a circular surface source.
The electron spectrum is assumed to be gaussian with a mean energy of 7.2 MeV and a standard deviation of 3%.
