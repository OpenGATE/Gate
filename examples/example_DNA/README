!! Be careful you must use the so-called "G4_WATER" material while using Geant4 DNA processes and models !!


---> Description

This example shows how to mix Standard and DNA physics list in the same simulation.

---> Set-up

The geometry consists in a world volume made of liquid water (G4_WATER material) including three boxes Target1, Target2, Target3 made of liquid water (G4_WATER material) of thickness 50 micrometers aligned along the Z axis.
Monoenergetic protons of 8 MeV are shot along the Z axis at 10 micrometers of the face of the first box Target1.

---> Physics

Geant4 Standard option 3 physics list is assigned to the world volume with a cut of 4 micrometers (2.9 keV electrons in liquid water).
Geant4 DNA physics list is assigned to Target1 and Target3 (note that cut is not active using Geant4 DNA processes and models).
A KillActor is used to kill electrons with kinetic energy below 8 eV. It prevents electrons to be trapped into single scattering.

---> Output

The production of secondary particles is scored in each Target via EnergySpectrumActor.
To analyse the spectrum with ROOT, use the plot.C macro file.
One can check the correct production of secondaries: from 2.9 keV in Target2, whereas the Geant4 DNA models in Target1 and Target3 are able to produce secondaries below 2.9 keV.
